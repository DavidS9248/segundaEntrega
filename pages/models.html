            <p>The Tesla Model 3 is a battery electric mid-size sedan with a fastback body style built by Tesla, Inc.
                since 2017. The Model 3 was marketed as being more affordable to more people than previous models by
                Tesla. The Model 3 was the world's top selling plug-in electric car for three years, from 2018 to 2020,
                before being knocked from the top spot by the Tesla Model Y, a crossover SUV based on the Model 3
                chassis. In June 2021, the Model 3 became the first electric car to pass global sales of 1 million. A
                refresh of the Tesla Model 3 was introduced in 2023, offering a revised exterior and interior.</p>

                The Tesla Model Y is a battery electric mid-size crossover SUV built by Tesla, Inc. since 2020.

                The Model Y is based on the Model 3 sedan platform. It shares an estimated 75 percent of its parts
                with the Tesla Model 3, which includes a similar interior and exterior design and electric
                powertrain. The Model Y fills a smaller and less expensive segment than the mid-sized Tesla Model X.
                Like the Model X, the Model Y offers optional third-row seats for a seven-passenger seating
                capacity.

                Unveiled in March 2019, it started production at its Fremont Factory in January 2020, and started
                deliveries on March 13, 2020.

                In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y outsold the Toyota Corolla to become the world's best-selling
                car, the first ever electric vehicle to claim the title.

            <h2>Tesla Model S</h2>
            <p>
                The Tesla Model S is a battery electric full-size luxury sedan with a liftback body style built by
                Tesla, Inc. since 2012. The Model S features a battery-powered dual-motor, all-wheel drive layout,
                although earlier versions featured a rear-motor and rear-wheel drive layout.

                Development of the Model S began prior to 2007, under the codename "WhiteStar". The Model S was
                officially announced on June 30, 2008, and a prototype vehicle was unveiled in March 2009. The Model S
                debuted on June 22, 2012. A revised, dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version, known as the 60D, debuted
                on October 9, 2014. The 60D was followed by the 70D, which made dual-motor and all-wheel drive the
                standard, followed by the 85D, P85D, and P90D. Along with these updates, Tesla offered the Autopilot
                driving assistance system. The first major design refresh came in April 2016 when the Model S was
                updated with a new front hood design. In October of the same year, hardware became standard that
                supports Tesla's Full Self Driving (FSD) capability. As part of the update, integrated standard cameras
                around the car were added. In February 2017 the Tesla Model S P100D debuted, which included a revised
                motor and was the first electric vehicle to have an EPA estimated range exceeding 300 miles (483 km).
                The second major design refresh, codenamed "Palladium", was introduced in June 2021, offering a new
                "Plaid" performance model, along with a revised interior, powertrain, and suspension.

                The Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new-car-sales ranking in any country,
                leading twice in Norway, in September and December 2013 and in Denmark in December
                2015. Sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018. The Model S was the top-selling
                plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016, although it was later surpassed by the Model
                3. Upon its release, the Model S received positive reviews, with praise for its acceleration
                and range, although initial models received criticism for their high cost and braking issues.

            <h2>Tesla Model X</h2>
            <p>
                The Tesla Model X is a battery electric mid-size luxury crossover SUV built by Tesla, Inc. since 2015.
                Developed from the full-sized sedan platform of the Tesla Model S, the vehicle notably uses falcon wing
                doors for passenger access.

                The Model X has an EPA size class as an SUV, and shares around 30 percent of its content with the
                Model S, half of the originally planned 60 percent, and weighs about 10 percent more. Both the Model X
                and Model S are produced at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. The prototype was unveiled at
                Tesla's design studios in Hawthorne, California on February 9, 2012. First deliveries of the Model
                X began in September 2015. After one full year on the market, in 2016, the Model X ranked seventh
                among the world's best-selling plug-in cars. A refresh of the Tesla Model X was introduced in 2021,
                offering a new "Plaid" performance model, along with a revised interior, powertrain, and suspension.

                As of September 2023, the Model X is available as a Long-Range version with an estimated EPA range of
                348 miles (560 km) and a high performance "Plaid" version with an estimated EPA range of 333 miles (536
                km).
